# Qubika SQL Interview

Local **livecoding SQL interview** tool. The interviewer runs it on their
laptop with one command; the app generates an **ephemeral public link**
(a Cloudflare quick tunnel or localhost.run — both free, no account) to paste
in the Google Meet chat.
The candidate opens the link and sees the exercise statement, the table
schemas with sample rows, a SQL editor, a Run button and the results. The
candidate shares their screen over Meet; the interviewer's terminal shows
every executed query live, with whether its result matches the reference
solution and short SQL style flags. **Ctrl+C ends the session and the link
dies instantly.**

Engine: embedded DuckDB (zero cost, no network, no Databricks). Data is 100%
synthetic — hard rule: never load real data into `exercises/`.

## Setup (one time)

```bash
brew install cloudflared   # optional: without it the link comes from localhost.run
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages duckdb
```

## Usage

Run it **in your own terminal window** and leave it open — that window *is*
the interview console:

```bash
python3 serve.py --candidate "Full Name"
```

`--candidate` is **required**: it names the candidate folder the session log
is written to, and also appears in the log, the banner and the farewell. Leave
it out and the app asks for it at the prompt; give it nothing and it exits
before starting anything. All commands here assume the app directory is your working directory. If it
isn't — e.g. the app is installed as a plugin under
`~/.claude/plugins/…/skills/run-DA-livecoding/app/` — use the absolute path
instead: `python3 "<APP>/serve.py"`. `serve.py` resolves its exercises, static
files and log directory from its own location, so it runs correctly from any
working directory.

The startup banner carries the whole procedure: the candidate link to paste
in the Meet chat, the reminder to have the candidate share their screen, where
the live query feed appears, and that **Ctrl+C in that window ends the
session** (the link dies instantly). Nothing else needs to be remembered.

Never start it in the background (`&`, `nohup`) or from a chat session: when
that parent dies it takes the candidate's link with it, mid-interview.

Other invocations:

```bash
python3 serve.py --list                                  # exercises + what each tests
python3 serve.py --exercise exercise_01,exercise_02      # subset
python3 serve.py --tunnel localhost.run                  # force one link provider
python3 serve.py --no-tunnel                             # localhost only (testing)
```

## The public link

Two providers are started at the same time — a **Cloudflare quick tunnel**
(`*.trycloudflare.com`, needs `cloudflared`) and **localhost.run**
(`*.lhr.life`, an SSH remote forward, needs nothing but `ssh`) — and the app
fetches its own public URL until this server answers through it. The first
link that does is shown; the other tunnel is shut down. A link is therefore
never printed on faith: Cloudflare hands out a hostname before its DNS record
exists (routinely ~20 s, and during an outage never), which used to put a dead
link in the Meet chat. Progress is printed every 5 s while waiting.
`--tunnel <provider>` forces one; if every provider fails the error lists each
reason and points at `--no-tunnel`. Despite its name, localhost.run is a public
service: the link works from anywhere.

All options, combinable:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--candidate "Full Name"` | **Required.** Names the candidate folder the log is written to, and appears in the log, the banner and the farewell. Asked for at the prompt if omitted. |
| `--exercise exercise_01,exercise_03` | Serve a subset. Default: all five. |
| `--tunnel cloudflare` / `--tunnel localhost.run` | Force one link provider. Default: start both and keep the first one that proves reachable. |
| `--no-tunnel` | Localhost only, no public link. The fallback when no provider works: share your own screen and the candidate dictates the SQL. |
| `--ttl 120` | Session lifetime in minutes (default 180) — a backstop in case you forget Ctrl+C. |
| `--port 8766` | Port (default 8765). Only needed when a previous session is still running. |
| `--list` | Print the exercises with the technique each one tests, then exit. |

## The live feed

Each run is one line: time, exercise, status, rows, ms, **result**, **style**
and the start of the query. Both new columns are interviewer-only — they are
never part of any HTTP response.

`result` compares the candidate's **result set** with the result of
`solution.sql`, never the SQL text, so a CTE, a subquery or different aliases
all pass:

| label | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS` | same data as the reference |
| `NEAR:cols` | right data, columns in another order |
| `NEAR:order` | right rows, wrong row order (only for exercises whose statement fixes an order) |
| `FAIL:cols` | wrong number of columns |
| `FAIL:rows` | wrong number of rows (says extra / missing / duplicates) |
| `FAIL:vals` | right shape, wrong values or wrong column type |
| `n/a` | no usable reference for this exercise |
| `?` | the check itself failed; the reason line says why |
| *(blank)* | the query failed, or it is an EXPLAIN/DESCRIBE, not an answer |

`FAIL` and `NEAR` print the reason on an indented second line. Column names
are ignored; numbers are compared after rounding to the exercise's `decimals`
(2 by default), so `SUM(...)`, `SUM(...)::DOUBLE` and a VARCHAR cast agree; a
date equals its ISO string; only the ORDER BY key columns are compared for
order, so tied rows may come back either way.

`style` is `ok` or a fixed set of flags:

| flag | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `T` | indented with tabs |
| `I` | sloppy indentation: a one-space indent, or two levels one space apart |
| `L` | a line over 100 chars, or a whole multi-clause query on one line |
| `S` | missing space around an operator or comma |
| `*` | `SELECT *` (`COUNT(*)` does not count) |
| `A` | expression column with no alias (`count(id)`) |
| *(blank)* | the style check was unavailable — not the same as `ok` |

Keyword casing is deliberately not judged: consistent lowercase and consistent
uppercase are both fine. `I` only reports indentation that is genuinely sloppy
(a one-space indent, or two levels one space apart), so river and
aligned-under-a-paren layouts pass. Full messages for every flag are in the log.

The banner's `Checks` line says how many exercises the result column can judge
and names the exceptions: `off` (no usable reference, so the cell shows `n/a`)
and `degraded` (a verdict is still given, but part of the check — so far only
the row order — is not being applied).

A Cloudflare subdomain is 4 random words; if an ugly or alarming name comes
up (e.g. "spyware-…"), the app discards it and mints another one before
showing it. localhost.run names are hexadecimal.

Everything is kept in a JSONL log for later review — queries, results,
rejections, each run's `check` verdict and `style` flags, the candidate's name
in `session_start`, and the final SQL of each exercise. It lands in the
candidate's own folder in the interviewer's workspace,
`<workspace>/Candidates/<Candidate Name>/<FirstnameLastname>_SQL_<ts>.jsonl`,
where `<workspace>` is `$DA_INTERVIEWS_DIR` if set, else
`~/qubika-da-interviews/`. That is deliberate: the SQL log sits next to the
CV, the transcript and the assessment for the same person, and
`assess-DA-interview` reads it from there instead of asking what happened.

Setting `DATA_ANALYTICS_LIVECODING_DATA_DIR` opts back into the old flat
layout, `<that dir>/sessions/<ts>_<candidate-slug>/`, which keeps every
session in one tree at the cost of that link. The tests use it for exactly
that reason.

## Suggested interview flow

1. 5 minutes before: run `serve.py` (see Usage for the path form) and check
   the link opens (ideally
   from your phone with WiFi off — that proves real remote access).
2. Paste the candidate link in the Meet chat and ask them to share their screen.
3. The 5 exercises are a difficulty ladder: count → JOIN+filter → GROUP BY
   per country → HAVING → Top-N. Candidate-facing names are deliberately
   neutral ("Exercise 1"…); the technique per exercise is in the `focus`
   field shown by `--list`, and each folder has a reference `solution.sql`
   (never served to the candidate).
4. When done: Ctrl+C. The link is dead and the log is saved.

**Plan B** if the candidate's corporate network blocks one provider's domain:
rerun with the other (`--tunnel localhost.run` / `--tunnel cloudflare`). If
both are blocked: `--no-tunnel`, share YOUR screen with the local page open
and have the candidate dictate the SQL.

## Exercise format

One folder per exercise under `exercises/`:

```
exercises/my_exercise/
├── exercise.json    {"title", "difficulty", "focus", "tables": [{"name","csv"}], "sample_rows", "check"}
├── statement.md     the prompt (simple markdown: headings, lists, **bold**, `code`)
├── schema.sql       CREATE TABLEs separated by ';' (standard types)
├── solution.sql     reference answer (interviewer only; also defines the expected result)
└── data/<table>.csv one CSV per table, with header (synthetic data ONLY)
```

The optional `check` block tunes the result column:

| key | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` switches the result column off for this exercise |
| `ordered` | `false` | `true` when the statement asks for a specific row order; naming `order_by` turns this on by itself |
| `order_by` | `[]` | solution column names that define that order (ties tolerated); `[]` with `ordered` means the whole row order must match. A name that is not a solution column is reported as `degraded` at startup |
| `decimals` | `2` | numbers are compared after rounding to this many decimals |

`solution.sql` runs once at startup on the same hardened connection. If it is
missing, fails, or returns more than 200 rows, the result column is switched
off for that exercise (with a warning) and the interview runs normally.

Authoring rules: candidate-facing titles and statements must not hint at the
solution technique (that goes in `focus`, interviewer-only); statements must
be explicit about the expected output shape; metric names must be consistent
between statement, schema and solution. The seed exercises are generated by
`gen_exercises.py` — edit and re-run it to tweak them.

It shows up automatically in `--list` and in the session. Porting the old
db-recruiter exercises is just a matter of dumping them into this format.

## Security (threat model: semi-trusted candidate + internet scanners)

- **Everything is token-gated**: every route requires `?t=<token>` (128 bits,
  constant-time comparison). Any other route → 404 — which is also how the
  startup check recognises its own server through the tunnel, without ever
  fetching the candidate page. The server only listens on 127.0.0.1; the
  tunnel is the only entry point. The link dies with the process.
- **The DuckDB connection is the real barrier**, not text validation:
  read-only + `enable_external_access=false` (blocks `read_csv('/etc/passwd')`,
  `ATTACH`, `COPY TO`, extensions) + `lock_configuration` (blocks SET/PRAGMA)
  + `memory_limit 512MB`. DB files live in a neutral temp dir so no path can
  leak the interviewer's username.
- Statement validation with DuckDB's real parser (single statement,
  SELECT/EXPLAIN only — DESCRIBE/SHOW count as SELECT).
- 30s timeout per query (interrupt), 200-row result cap, 2,000-char cell cap,
  1 concurrent query, min 2s between runs, 256 KB max body.
- Automatic `caffeinate` so the laptop doesn't sleep mid-interview.
- Result verdicts, style flags and the candidate's name never leave the
  process: `/api/run` returns exactly `{status, columns, rows, row_count,
  truncated, duration_ms, error}`.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests   # or: -s "<APP>/tests"
```

## Manual E2E checklist (before the first real interview)

1. `--no-tunnel`: tabs, run all 5 exercises, a refresh doesn't lose the SQL,
   Ctrl+C stops it.
2. With tunnel: open the link from your phone with WiFi off, run a query,
   Ctrl+C and verify the link is dead. Try `--tunnel cloudflare` and
   `--tunnel localhost.run` once each.
3. Paste attacks: `DROP TABLE orders` · `SELECT 1; SELECT 2` ·
   `SELECT * FROM read_csv('/etc/passwd')` · spam Run — all rejected and
   logged.
4. `--ttl 1` and watch the expiry ("Session ended" banner).
5. Answer one exercise wrongly (drop the `LIMIT`, return the id instead of the
   name) and then correctly but written differently (a CTE, other aliases):
   `FAIL:*` with a reason, then `PASS`.
6. `--candidate "Ana Test"`: the banner shows the name, the log lands in
   `<workspace>/Candidates/Ana Test/AnaTest_SQL_<ts>.jsonl`, and Ctrl+C names
   the candidate in the farewell.
7. No `--candidate` at all: it asks for the name at the prompt. Answer with a
   blank line three times, or Ctrl+C, and it exits without starting a session
   or leaving a folder behind.

## Future evolution (deliberately out of v1)

- **Branded link (`sql-livecoding.qubika.com`)**: free quick tunnels get a
  random 4-word subdomain that cannot be chosen (the app already discards
  off-putting names and mints a new one). A fixed, Qubika-branded URL requires
  a Cloudflare *named tunnel*: a free Cloudflare account + a Qubika-owned
  domain/subdomain routed through it. ~1h of one-time setup, then
  `cloudflared tunnel run` with a config file replaces the quick tunnel.

- **Databricks SQL Warehouse engine**: same exercise format; reuse the
  CLI-subprocess pattern from `projects/bench_projections/fetch_bench.py`
  against the Statement Execution API (`on_wait_timeout: CANCEL`,
  `row_limit`), profile `qubika-training`. The app already isolates the
  engine in `engine.py`.
- Live web mirror (SSE) + admin page with "End session", if someday the
  candidate doesn't share their screen.
- Port the historical db-recruiter exercises.
