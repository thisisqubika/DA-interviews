  This skill should be used when the user wants to run a live SQL interview —
  e.g. "run a SQL interview", "start the livecoding interview", "SQL
  livecoding session", "prepara la entrevista de SQL", "corre la entrevista de
  livecoding", "give me the interview link", "list the SQL exercises", "show
  me the interview solutions", "what has the candidate run", or "end the
  interview". It hands the interviewer a ready-to-paste terminal command that
  starts a local, sandboxed SQL exercise app behind an ephemeral public link
  (Cloudflare quick tunnel or localhost.run, whichever answers first), and
  helps with exercises, solutions and troubleshooting.

# Qubika SQL Interview

Live SQL interviews from the interviewer's own laptop. The app (bundled in
`app/` next to this SKILL.md) serves SQL exercises against an embedded,
hardened DuckDB engine and prints every query the candidate runs, together
with whether its result matches the reference solution and a few SQL style
flags. The public link dies the moment the server process stops.

## The one rule: the interviewer owns the process

**Never start the app yourself — not in the foreground, not in the background,
not with `nohup`.** The interview server must run in the interviewer's own
terminal window, where they can see the live queries and stop it with Ctrl+C.
A server started from a chat session dies with that session and takes the
candidate's link down mid-interview.

Your job is to hand over the exact command, explain the flow, and help with
everything around it. The terminal banner itself carries the full
instructions, so you do not need to repeat them at length.

## Start an interview

1. Resolve `APP` = the absolute path of the `app/` directory next to this
   SKILL.md.
2. Preflight (these are read-only, safe to run yourself):
   - `which cloudflared` — if missing: `brew install cloudflared` (macOS).
     Not fatal: without it the link comes from localhost.run over plain
     `ssh`, which every Mac has.
   - `python3 -c "import duckdb"` — if missing:
     `python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages duckdb`.
   Fix these before handing over the command; a failure mid-interview is
   much worse than a 30-second check now.
3. Ask for the candidate's full name if they have not already given it — one
   short question. It is **required**: it names the workspace folder the
   session log is written to, which is what lets `assess-DA-interview` find
   that log afterwards. Without it the app refuses to start (it asks at the
   prompt when the flag is missing, and exits if it gets no answer), so get
   the name before handing the command over.
4. Give the user this command in a `bash` code block, with `APP` already
   expanded to the real absolute path — one command, nothing else in the
   block, so it is one click to run:

   ```bash
   python3 "<APP>/serve.py" --candidate "<Full Name>"
   ```

   `--candidate` is the one flag that is not optional. Tell them to run it
   **in their own terminal**. Optional flags, mention only if relevant: `--exercise
   exercise_01,exercise_02` (subset), `--ttl <minutes>` (default 180), `--port
   <port>` (default 8765), `--tunnel cloudflare` or `--tunnel localhost.run`
   (force one provider), `--no-tunnel` (localhost only, candidate cannot
   reach it).
5. Tell them what to expect: within about 30 seconds the terminal prints a
   banner with the candidate link and the numbered steps. The link is
   **checked before it is shown**: the app starts a Cloudflare quick tunnel and
   a localhost.run tunnel at the same time, fetches its own public URL until
   the server answers through it, keeps the first one that does and shuts the
   other down. The banner names the provider. While waiting it prints a
   `still checking…` line every 5 seconds, so silence means something is wrong. They copy the link into the Meet
   chat, the candidate shares their screen, and every query streams into that
   window with two extra columns:
   - **result** — the candidate's result set compared with the result of
     `solution.sql`: `PASS`, `NEAR:cols` / `NEAR:order` (right data, other
     column or row order), `FAIL:cols` / `FAIL:rows` / `FAIL:vals` with the
     reason on the next line, `n/a` (no reference for this exercise), or `?`
     (the check itself failed — the reason line says why). It compares **data,
     not SQL text**, so CTEs, subqueries and different aliases all pass. The
     cell is blank when the query failed or was an EXPLAIN/DESCRIBE-style
     query, which is not an answer.
   - **style** — `ok`, or flags: `T` indented with tabs, `I` sloppy
     indentation (a one-space indent, or two levels one space apart), `L`
     layout (a long line, or a whole multi-clause query on one line), `S`
     missing spaces, `*` `SELECT *`, `A` expression column with no alias.
     Casing is not judged, and river or aligned formatting is not either. A
     blank style cell means the check was unavailable, not that the SQL was
     clean.
   - The `Checks` line in the banner says how many exercises the result column
     can judge, and names any exercise that is off or degraded.

   Both are interviewer-only and never reach the candidate. The banner carries
   the same legend. The session log goes to the candidate's own folder in the
   interviewer's workspace:
   `<workspace>/Candidates/<Candidate Name>/<FirstnameLastname>_SQL_<timestamp>.jsonl`,
   where `<workspace>` is `$DA_INTERVIEWS_DIR` if set, else
   `~/qubika-da-interviews/`. That puts the SQL log next to the CV, the
   transcript and the assessment for the same person, which is where
   `assess-DA-interview` reads it from. Setting
   `DATA_ANALYTICS_LIVECODING_DATA_DIR` opts back into the old flat layout
   (`<that dir>/sessions/<timestamp>_<candidate-slug>/`), at the cost of that
   link.

## End an interview

**Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it is running.** That is the whole
procedure — it kills the link instantly and prints a summary with the log
path. Say exactly that; do not run anything.

Only if the user cannot find or reach that window: identify the right process
first, then signal it by PID. **Never `pkill -f serve.py`** — it matches every
serve.py on the machine (the dev checkout and the plugin copy included) and
would end someone else's live interview.

```bash
pgrep -fl serve.py
```

The banner of each session prints its own `pid` and port, so the user can tell
them apart. Have them confirm which PID is theirs, then:

```bash
kill -INT <PID>
```

## During an interview

- **"What has the candidate run?"** — the live feed is in their terminal. If
  they want it here, read the session log, which is appended live:
  `<workspace>/Candidates/<Candidate Name>/<FirstnameLastname>_SQL_<newest>.jsonl`
  (one JSON line per query: SQL, status, rows, duration, the `check` verdict
  with its reason and the `style` flags with full messages; plus each
  exercise's final editor text). The `session_start` line carries the
  candidate's name. Read the JSONL, never the console feed — the console
  truncates each query at about 100 characters, cutting off exactly the join
  conditions and `GROUP BY`/`HAVING` clauses that decide whether an answer
  was right.
- **"Is my answer right?"** — the result column already answers that per run;
  for nuance, compare against the reference solution (below).
- Never open or interact with the candidate link yourself; it is their
  session.

## Exercises and solutions

- `python3 "<APP>/serve.py" --list` shows each exercise with its
  interviewer-only `focus` (the technique it tests). The seed set is a
  difficulty ladder: COUNT → JOIN+filter → GROUP BY per country → HAVING →
  Top-N. Candidate-facing names are deliberately neutral ("Exercise 1"…).
- Reference answers: `<APP>/exercises/<name>/solution.sql` — never served to
  the candidate. When asked for "the solutions", read those files; you can
  also run them with duckdb against the seed CSVs to show expected outputs.
- To add or edit exercises: each is a folder under `<APP>/exercises/` with
  `exercise.json`, `statement.md`, `schema.sql`, `solution.sql` and
  `data/*.csv` (synthetic data ONLY — hard rule). Authoring rules: titles and
  statements must not hint at the solution technique (that goes in `focus`),
  statements must be explicit about the expected output shape, and metric
  names must match between statement, schema and solution. The seed set is
  generated by `<APP>/gen_exercises.py`.
- `exercise.json` may carry a `"check"` block that tunes the result column:
  `{"ordered": true, "order_by": ["order_count"], "decimals": 2, "enabled":
  true}`. Set `ordered`/`order_by` whenever the statement asks for a specific
  order — only those key columns are compared, so tied rows may come back
  either way. `solution.sql` is run once at startup to build the expected
  result; if it is missing, fails, or returns more than 200 rows, the result
  column is switched off **for that exercise only** (a warning is printed) and
  the interview runs normally.

## Troubleshooting

- **A startup warning like `⚠️  exercise_03: no solution.sql — result column
  off`** — that exercise shows `n/a` instead of a verdict; the interview itself
  is unaffected and every other exercise still gets one. The column is switched
  off when `solution.sql` is missing, when it fails to run (the warning quotes
  the first line of the error), or when it returns more than 200 rows. Setting
  `check.enabled` to `false` also switches it off, deliberately without a
  warning. A warning naming `check.order_by` means the verdict still works but
  the row order is not being checked — the banner marks that exercise
  `degraded`.
- **Port already in use** — a previous server is still running in another
  window. Either Ctrl+C there, or rerun with `--port 8766`. Two interviews can
  legitimately run at once, which is why killing by name is forbidden above.
- **The link is `*.lhr.life` instead of `*.trycloudflare.com`** — normal:
  Cloudflare was slow or down and localhost.run won the race. Despite the
  name, localhost.run is a public service; the link works from anywhere.
  `--tunnel cloudflare` forces Cloudflare when it matters.
- **"No public link could be established"** — both providers failed; the
  message lists each reason. Rerun with `--no-tunnel`, share your own screen
  with the local link open, and have the candidate dictate SQL.
- **Candidate's network blocks the provider's domain** — rerun with the other
  one (`--tunnel localhost.run` or `--tunnel cloudflare`), or fall back to
  `--no-tunnel` as above.
- **Link stopped working mid-interview** — the tunnel dropped (the terminal
  prints a warning). Ctrl+C and start again; the new link must be re-pasted
  in the Meet chat. The candidate's typed SQL is not carried over.
- Full details, security model and E2E checklist: `<APP>/README.md`. Its
  commands are written to be run from the app directory; rewrite any command
  you relay as `python3 "<APP>/…"` with `APP` expanded.
- Sanity check after changes: `python3 -m unittest discover -s "<APP>/tests"`.

## Security notes (already enforced by the app — do not weaken)

Every route is token-gated; the DuckDB connection is read-only with external
access disabled (candidates cannot read local files, write, or change
config); 30s query timeout, 200-row cap, rate limiting. The candidate only
ever sees the exercise content: verdicts, style flags and the candidate's name
live in the terminal and the JSONL log, never in any HTTP response.
